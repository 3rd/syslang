# Syslang

Syslang (or _slang_) is my personal document syntax.

This project was inspired by [Geir Isene's HyperList](https://isene.org/hyperlist/), Org, Markdown, AsciiDoc, and others.

This repository can serve as a reference on how to get started if you want to create your own Tree-sitter grammar,
integrate it into your editor (with highlights, folds, syntax injection), and build other standalone software using it.

- Tree-sitter grammar - [./tree-sitter-syslang](./tree-sitter-syslang)
- Go library - [./go-syslang](./go-syslang)
- [Neovim plugin](https://github.com/3rd/config/tree/master/home/dotfiles/nvim/plugins/syslang)
- [nvim-treesitter config](https://github.com/3rd/config/blob/master/home/dotfiles/nvim/lua/modules/language-support/tree-sitter.lua#L5)
